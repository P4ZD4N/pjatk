# PJATK

In this repository, I am showing the solutions of tasks, exercises, and projects that I have completed during my IT studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. The collection contains a various range of challenges I have tackled, including various technologies, methodologies, and levels of difficulty.

This repo contains only solutions of tasks related to software engineering. While these solutions showcase my skills and knowledge in this specific area, it's worth mentioning that I have also completed numerous other assignments and projects in different fields of IT. However, I chose not to include them in this repository to maintain a clear focus on Software Engineering.
